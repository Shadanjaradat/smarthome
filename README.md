# Smart Home Appliances Control 

This program focuses on how sensors and actuators can be used to automate house appliances by simply storing, accessing, and interpreting data stored for control purposes while calculating energy consumption.
The data in txt files contain sensor data recorded over every hour interval to control the appliances (ventilation system, heating system, and lights)
This project represents a potential concept that can be altered to be used into real world appliances.

The txt file living, bedroom, and kitchen display the sensor data for motion, light, and humidity sensors that are required to read, store, and use.
The location of these files have to be altered from within the files to be able to read them.
Several txt files are then generated to display the state of either a specific appliance in all rooms, or all appliances within that room.
The program runs using the user interface program which allows the user to choose the action required next.
